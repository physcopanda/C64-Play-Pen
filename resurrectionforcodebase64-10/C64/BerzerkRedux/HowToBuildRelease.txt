How to build the release disk version.
Create a new D64 with C:\CCS64\TOOLS\D64Editor\D64Editor.exe
Disk name: BERZERK REDUX
Disk ID: 01 14

Workspace C64\DiskBootLoader\DiskBootLoader.dsw
Make sure the jmp $80d is active because this is the start address of the MartyLoad code.
Assemble.
Copy DiskBootLoader.prg to the D64 and name it BOOT.

Workspace C64\BerzerkRedux\BerzerkRedux.dsw
Make sure IRQDisk_NoDriveCode is disabled.
Make sure the debug is turned off and the title screen version is correct.
Assemble.
Copy "save" to the D64 and make sure it is named SAVE.

Workspace C64\PictureLink\PictureLink.dsw
Assemble. Note the adress of RealStart and make sure the BASIC SYS command uses this address.
Assemble again, to be sure. Run, to check it displays stuff correctly.

Workspace C64\IRQDisk\IRQDisk.dsw
In TestIRQDisk2.a make sure the jmp near the "NOTE:" is the correct address for RealStart per the comment.
Make sure it assembles TestIRQDisk2.a
Assemble
..\bin\LZMPi.exe -c64b TestIRQDisk.prg t.prg $c000

Now copy C64\IRQDisk\t.prg to the D64 and name it MAIN.
Now copy C64\PictureLink\PictureLink.prg to the D64 and name it GAME.
